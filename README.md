## üìñ Description

SunspotsYoloDataset is a set of 1690+380+128 high-resolution RGB astronomical images captured with smart telescopes with specific solar filters and annotated with the positions of sunspots that are effectively in the images. 
Two instruments were used for several months from Luxembourg and France between January 2023 and May 2024: a Stellina smart telescope (https://vaonis.com/stellina) and a Vespera smart telescope (https://vaonis.com/vespera).

SunspotsYoloDataset can be used to train YOLO detection models on solar images, enabling the prediction of unexpected events such as Borealis Aurora with astronomical equipment accessible to the public.


## üìú Dataset Structure

SunspotsYoloDataset is formatted with the YOLO standard, i.e., with separated files for images and annotations, usable by state-of-the-art training tools and graphical software like MakeSense (https://www.makesense.ai). 
More precisely, there is a ZIP file containing RGB images in JPEG format (minimal compression), and text files containing the positions of sunspots. 
Each RGB image has a resolution of 640 √ó 640 pixels.


## üìë Examples

The dataset was used to train a YOLOv7 model -- allowing to obtain the following results.
